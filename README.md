This project was completed in **Google Colab** as part of a freelance Upwork job.  
It demonstrates how Python can be used to:
- Clean and preprocess epidemiological data
- Merge case counts with Indian state boundaries (GeoJSON)
- Generate animated choropleth maps (GIFs) showing temporal spread
- Highlight major cities for geographic context
